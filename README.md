# PvZ-GW-Map-Loader
Level loader for Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare on PC.

# How to Use It
Download the latest release and inject it with a DLL injector of your choice (this may be changed at a later point in time). You must be the host and not in the main menu for this to work.

In the "Level Name" text box, input a LevelData's asset name.

In the "Inclusion Options" text box, input a level's layer inclusion options.
